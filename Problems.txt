Please answer any or all of the following questions. You can keep your answers brief - no more than 10 lines each. Use pseudocode, Python, or Java. Thanks!

1) Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.

2) Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements. For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].

3) Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.
